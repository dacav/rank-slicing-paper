\abstract{
    \kLeader consists in identifying, in the context of a distributed
    network, a subset of super-nodes to be assigned to a certain
    application-dependent role.  Such service is very useful for many
    distributed applications. This paper proposes \RankSlicing a
    pragmatical and general purpose distributed solution, which aims at
    real-world deployment networks.  The algorithm allows an applicative
    logic to specify the requirements for nodes to be leader, and provides
    each node with a picture of the leader set, along with a reliability
    measure of it. The system quickly adapts to both global and node-wise
    dynamics.
